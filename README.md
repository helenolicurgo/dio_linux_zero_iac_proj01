# DIO boot-camp "Linux do Zero" IaC Project01

Only for educational purpose at DIO for the boot-camp "Linux do Zero". 

> Attention:

-> I diverge from the basic instructions just to give a more personal flavor to the bash script.

-> NOTHING that will break the project.

-> All commands and sintax are preserved and TESTED.


> Test instructions:

echo "To change permission to run the bash script: sudo chmod +x dio_linux_zero_iac.sh"

echo "To run the bash script: sudo ./dio_linux_zero_iac.sh"

echo "To check Users: sudo cat /etc/passwd"
